Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Neopets Name Availability Checker, an innovative tool designed to automate the process of checking for available usernames on Neopets. Built with Python and leveraging Selenium for web automation, this application simplifies the task of finding unique and creative names for Neopets by automating searches based on customizable parameters. It features a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter, making it accessible to users of all skill levels.

Key Features:
Customizable Search Parameters: Users can specify desired characters, word length, and other criteria to personalize their name search.
Automated Web Navigation: Utilizes Selenium WebDriver to interact with the Neopets website, automatically entering search terms and parsing results.
GUI for Easy Interaction: The Tkinter-based GUI offers an intuitive interface for setting search parameters and initiating the search process.
Advanced Options: Includes options for capitalizing the first letter, requiring double letters, and setting the time interval between searches to mimic human behavior.
Results Handling: The application saves available names to a specified text file, making it easy to review and choose your favorites.
How It Works:
Setup and Login: Users enter their Neopets login credentials through the GUI, which the tool uses to sign in to the Neopets website.
Name Search Configuration: Through the GUI, users can configure their search template, including preferred characters, name length, and other options like capitalization and double letters.
Automated Search: Upon initiating the search, the tool automatically queries the Neopets name availability checker according to the user's specifications, cycling through potential names.
Save and Review: Available names are saved to a user-specified file, allowing for easy review and selection after the search is complete.
